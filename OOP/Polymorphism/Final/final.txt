Tasks:

final keyword:

Scenario 1: Math Constants
In a mathematical calculation library, define a class called "MathConstants" with final variables for commonly used mathematical constants like pi and e. These variables cannot be modified and hold their constant values throughout the program.

Scenario 2: Configuration Settings
In a configuration management system, define a class called "Configuration" with final variables for system settings like database URL, username, and password. These variables cannot be modified and represent fixed configuration values.

Scenario 3: Math Calculations
In a math calculation library, define a class called "MathUtils" with final methods for commonly used mathematical calculations like square root and logarithm. These methods cannot be overridden and provide consistent behavior throughout the program.
