Instace Initializer Block: it is used to initialize the instance data member.
Priority Wise: Constructor > super() > iib > body of constructor

Tasks:
1. Temperature Converter: Create a class that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Use an instance initializer block to set default conversion factors.

2. Math Operations: Develop a class that performs mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.). Initialize required constants and variables within an instance initializer block.

3. Geometry Calculator: Create a class for calculating geometric shapes. Implement an instance initializer block to define default values for shape properties.

4. Time Zone Converter: Design a class for converting times between different time zones. Utilize an instance initializer block to set default time zone offsets.
